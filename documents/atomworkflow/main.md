# Open academic writing: An Atom-based workflow for social scientists

## Motivation

Writing (and reading) as a key characteristic of academic life. A large part of our time as academic is in front of the computer, writing.t

What do we use for this? Text processors software.

Which ones? Usually one: Word, which has become a monopoly in this regard.

Is there something wrong with this? No ... and yes. I we use it simply because we are used to do it, turns our computer on a nice typewriter with lots of buttons,functions and pre-defined options that save us time to think.

So, why are some sort of prophet folks promoting the plain text thing? Why come back to the past and throw the nice advances of text processor software? Because it makes the academic writing a process that includes and promotes the fundamentals of open science.

  - First a more philosophical reason: ownership, the base for sharing and collaboration. Do you completely own your .docx document? Can you access the content independent of a commercial and non-proprietary software? Well, it is a bit difficult but yes, you could move to a free alternative as Open Office, but still it is dependent of the existence of a software of which you don't have the complete control.

  - Second, a more practical reason: the possibility of **version control** in a collaborative environment. Ok, it is possible to do collaboration with track-changes functions, as well as some intuitive version control in other environments (such as final_final_final.docx), but clearly is not very efficient. Besides, this works when we only think of writing, but what if we include in the process of writing also the data analysis?

  - Efficiency: a single working environment for different applications. From the same editor you can write in different languages (i.e. LaTeX, Markdown), make presentations, version control, data analysis, export to different outputs (word, html, pdf)

  - Fourth: focus on the content instead of the format.

But ... being convinced is not enough. Writing in an open environment brings about all the diversity of open software alternatives for plain text editing, as well as different workflows including a variety of complements.
