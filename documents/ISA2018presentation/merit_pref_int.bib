In order to do so, we first introduce the multilevel model of sociological explanation and derive four perspectives of sociological justice research: the analysis of institution Error! Bookmark not defined. s and discourses on the societal level and the analysis of attitudes and behavior on the individual level. As sociological attitude research is the field with the most advanced theories and the broadest stock of empirical findings, we will focus on such and report its central theoretical developments and main empirical results. We restrict our review to what is usually called ``distributive justice'' i.e., justice conceptions related to the allocation and distribution of goods (primarily income and wealth) and burdens (e.g., taxes or welfare payment).},

Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with respondents from higher and lower social classes, the paper reconstructs the `moral economy' that underlies popular views of inequality. While respondents agree with abstract inegalitarian principles\textemdash{}i.e. income differentiation based on merit\textemdash{}they are concerned with specific instances of inequality, especially poverty and wealth. These are criticized because they are seen to imply intolerable deviations, both upwards and downwards, from a way of living presumed as universal, thereby fostering a segregation of life-worlds and social disintegration. Thus, perceptions of injustice do not seem to be based on the existence of income inequality as such, but rather on the view that economic disparities threaten the social bond.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Legitimacy}} of {{Economic Inequality}}},
  abstract = {This research is an empirical study of the legitimacy of economic inequality with a focus on the case of Chile. Chile is an appealing case study in this regard because it has been one of the countries with the highest indexes of economic inequality over the past several decades. Theoretical perspectives based on the rational interest of the median voter have pointed out a negative association between high levels of inequality and legitimacy. Nevertheless, empirical evidence indicates that an unequal distribution of income is not necessarily challenged by the majority of a society, a phenomenon associated with the concept of legitimacy of economic inequality. Most empirical studies of this topic to date have considered social contexts that are not characterized by (comparatively) high levels of income inequality; thus, the impact of the level of inequality on its legitimacy remains largely unclear. The present study aimed at bridging this research gap, guided by the question: How do high levels of income inequality in a society influence the legitimacy of economic inequality? Using data obtained by comparative public opinion projects including the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and the International Social Justice Project (ISJP), this research considered individual preferences for occupational earnings inequality (the just earnings gap) as the main object of study. The central hypothesis was that individual preferences are strongly influenced by contextual standards such as the current income distribution, leading individuals of countries with high levels of inequality to have stronger average preferences for economic inequality (the so-called existential argument). Empirical evidence of legitimacy was related to two central dimensions based on David Beetham's multidimensional concept of legitimacy: (a) consensus regarding the inequality in the distribution of earnings in Chile and (b) the impact of the country level of income inequality on individual preferences for a larger just earnings gap. The empirical analysis provided partial evidence regarding the consensus about inequality in Chile, whereas in an international comparative framework, countries with higher levels of income inequality showed a stronger preference for a larger just earnings gap.},

Using the International Social Survey Program Social Inequality III (1999) survey, we investigate the impact of education on perceptions and support, at both the individual and the country level. At the individual level, education strengthens support for education-based meritocracy but has less impact on perceptions of meritocracy. National indicators are also associated with perceived and preferred meritocracy. Perceived meritocracy is correlated with the expansion of the education system, while the support for education-based meritocracy is correlated with average returns to education. We also find that perceptions and preferences may be affected by such national characteristics as inequality and the average wealth.},

Few studies, however, have examined whether people believe they live in a meritocratic society. In this paper, we use the 1987 and 2010 General Social Survey to examine people's perceptions of meritocracy in the U.S. Although most Americans agree that getting ahead depends on meritocratic elements like hard work, their beliefs vary in strength. They disagree even more about the importance of non-meritocratic elements such as family wealth, and race. Furthermore, Americans layer these beliefs on top of each other to create a variety of perspectives on meritocracy. Young, upper class Whites are most likely to see the U.S. as a place where meritocratic elements rule. Older, lower class minorities, in contrast, are most likely to believe that non-meritocratic elements dominate. There are also Americans who believe strongly in both types of elements and those who do not believe strongly in either.},

Using the International Social Survey Project (ISSP): Social Inequality Module (1992), we examine both individual-level and country-level determinants of pro-meritocratic attitudes. According to self-interest and rational-action theories, individuals with high educational attainment and high personal income are expected to have strong meritocratic beliefs because meritocracy is in their best interest\textemdash{}they would gain under such a system. At the same time, both modernization and post-industrial theories imply that persons living in countries with a high degree of societal meritocracy hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than persons living in countries with low degree of societal meritocracy. Results of the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis on a data set including 7,972 persons from 14 countries indicate that the impact of individuals' education and income on meritocratic attitudes occurred as theoretically predicted. We also demonstrate that the relationship between the degree of societal meritocracy and the degree of support for such a system is statistically significant even if national wealth and educational stock (as well as individual-level variables) are controlled. In addition, we discovered that at the beginning of the 1990s a post-communist regime had a negative effect on support for meritocracy.},

This article analyzes the impact of local inequality on citizens' belief in a core facet of the American ethos\textemdash{}meritocracy. We advance conditional effects hypotheses that collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal counties, we find no significant differences between high- and low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality for American democracy.},

Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study's own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three distinctly different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.},

  abstract = {How does success accumulate? While the winner-take-all phenomenon has been viewed as a process of accumulating demand that results from a huge number of consumers making the same purchase decision, the conditions and interactions on the supply side have received scant attention in the literature. This paper investigates six ways sociology could contribute toward shedding light on the winner-take-all phenomenon, all of which seek to explain unequal success by examining the social structures of the labor market in which the actors are embedded. The author takes a preliminary, exploratory look from a sociological perspective at an aspect of inequality that is socially significant, yet poorly understood. The approaches presented open the way for future empirical study.},
