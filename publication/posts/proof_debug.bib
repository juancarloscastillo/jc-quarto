  abstract = {We analyze economic elites’ perceptions and beliefs about meritocracy from a moral economy perspective. A moral economy perspective considers how norms and beliefs structure socioeconomic practices through the constitution and expression of what is considered acceptable, proper, and legitimate. Our study explores how economic elites make sense of the roles of talent and effort in the distribution of resources and how they reconcile the idea of meritocracy within a rigid social order. The site of our study is Chile, a country with fluid mobility between low and middle classes, but with high and persistent disparities and strong barriers to elite positions. We conducted 44 semistructured interviews with shareholders, board members, and high-level executives of large or high-turnover companies in three major Chilean cities. We find that the economic elite strongly support meritocracy but explain access to top positions based on talent rather than effort. The economic elite define talent in terms of business and leadership skills. They attribute upward mobility in the private sector to meritocratic practice. At the same time, they view the public sector as the epitome of nonmeritocratic practices, incompetence, and inefficiency. They profess empathy with the poor, but they reject redistributive policies. The economic elite believe in the primacy of competition in economic life and the necessity of continual economic growth, and thus, they understand meritocracy as both the means to survive in a market economy and a responsible approach to lead national development.},

  abstract = {This paper lays out the lessons and challenges that stem from the last 25 years of research on Chilean elites. Particular emphasis is given to works that study economic elites. Based on 12 in-depth interviews with some of the main researchers in the field, the paper offers a systematic analysis of the grounds on which these researchers justify their use of the concept of elites to refer to the upper strata of Chilean society, in detriment of other concepts such as ruling class or aristocracy. The paper also analyzes the approaches and strategies used by them, their samples and methods, and the difficulties they find in the fieldwork, contributing to a reflexive analysis on the ways of researching the contemporary elites. Finally, challenges and avenues for future research in~this area are proposed.},
