  abstract = {We analyze economic elites’ perceptions and beliefs about meritocracy from a moral economy perspective. A moral economy perspective considers how norms and beliefs structure socioeconomic practices through the constitution and expression of what is considered acceptable, proper, and legitimate. Our study explores how economic elites make sense of the roles of talent and effort in the distribution of resources and how they reconcile the idea of meritocracy within a rigid social order. The site of our study is Chile, a country with fluid mobility between low and middle classes, but with high and persistent disparities and strong barriers to elite positions. We conducted 44 semistructured interviews with shareholders, board members, and high-level executives of large or high-turnover companies in three major Chilean cities. We find that the economic elite strongly support meritocracy but explain access to top positions based on talent rather than effort. The economic elite define talent in terms of business and leadership skills. They attribute upward mobility in the private sector to meritocratic practice. At the same time, they view the public sector as the epitome of nonmeritocratic practices, incompetence, and inefficiency. They profess empathy with the poor, but they reject redistributive policies. The economic elite believe in the primacy of competition in economic life and the necessity of continual economic growth, and thus, they understand meritocracy as both the means to survive in a market economy and a responsible approach to lead national development.},

Based on 12 in-depth interviews with some of the main researchers in the field, the paper offers a systematic analysis of the grounds on which these researchers justify their use of the concept of elites to refer to the upper strata of Chilean society, in detriment of other concepts such as ruling class or aristocracy. The paper also analyzes the approaches and strategies used by them, their samples and methods, and the difficulties they find in the fieldwork, contributing to a reflexive analysis on the ways of researching the contemporary elites. Finally, challenges and avenues for future research in~this area are proposed.},

This research note shows the results from a first stage of a wider research project on meritocracy and distributive preferences in Chile, which is based on 9 interviews with social science scholars whose research is related to these issues. Findings show that researchers refer to merit and meritocracy not only departing from different definitions but also giving them contentious social relevance. Furthermore, effort takes precedence over talent, a more developed dimension in international research. The results are discussed taking the Chilean socio-cultural context into account, characterized by rapid neoliberal modernization as well as high economic inequality.},

  abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the relationship between income and egalitarian values and attitudes towards healthcare policy. Study design Cross-sectional and cross-national study. Methods Data for 29 countries from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) 2011 were used. The dependent variables are a general attitude towards government involvement in healthcare provision and two attitudes regarding specific policies (taxes and public funding). Income and egalitarianism were also measured by using ISSP. Data were analysed using regression models that account for individual and country-level characteristics, and country-fixed effects. Results The effect of income is small and non-significant for attitudes towards government involvement and public funding. For willingness to pay (WTP) taxes to improve healthcare services, we find a positive association with income. Results for egalitarianism suggest a positive association with government involvement in healthcare provision and significant interactions with WTP taxes. Conclusions The distinction of dimensions and mechanisms underlying policy attitudes appears as relevant. Citizens across socioeconomic groups are motivated to support state-funded healthcare, favouring the design of non-selfish policies. These findings suggest that there is space for policymakers who seek to increase healthcare spending encouraging either policies for specific groups or broader institutional changes.},

Contrary to previous studies that explain cross-sectional variation between countries, we examine how political trust has evolved within countries across time in the region. We base our empirical analysis in the Latinobarometer dataset, which contains relevant measures of political trust since 1996 onwards, and consider how both individual and contextual characteristics have possibly triggered (or not) changes in political trust among the population. Results from Bayesian ordinal probit multi-level models indicate that within-country variation in political trust is strongly influenced by changes in per capita income as well as by the ideological orientation of governments. More specifically, countries that become richer and that have governments that adopt increasingly left-wing policies raise the aggregate levels of trust for three of the four political institutions we consider, namely, Congress, Political parties and Government. This positive influence of left-wing changes is mostly concentrated among government supporters in the case of Congress and Government, while it seems to apply to the population at large when it comes to political parties.},

In such a context, it becomes crucial to explore the relationship between the curricular guidelines and how citizenship education is currently acquired by students in Latin American countries. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to comparatively evaluate the institutional view of citizenship expressed in each curriculum and students’ attitudes on civic issues. The exploratory factor analysis and curricular descriptive statistical analysis are based in two valuable and complementary sources, respectively: The Latin American module of the International Civic and Citizenship Study (ICCS) and the Regional System of Citizenship Skills (Sredecc). By making a systematic comparison of both sources, this study reveals that several curricular aspects are consistent with students’ citizenship attitudes and beliefs, and suggests some guidelines for improving and expanding citizenship education in Latin America, considering the importance of education for the formation of an active citizenship.},

El objetivo del estudio es indagar cómo los vínculos sociales conforman ideales sobre justificación de la desigualdad social. Para ello, se propone utilizar el enfoque de redes sociales egocéntricas. Utilizando la encuesta ELSOC 2016 (n=2983), y por medio de modelos de regresión logístico ordinales, se testea si características de las redes, composición y diversidad, se relacionan con la justificación de la desigualdad social en Chile.

  abstract = {In an era of mass migration, social scientists, populist parties and social movements raise concerns over the future of immigration-destination societies. What impacts does this have on policy and social solidarity? Comparative cross-national research, relying mostly on secondary data, has findings in different directions. There is a threat of selective model reporting and lack of replicability. The heterogeneity of countries obscures attempts to clearly define data-generating models. P-hacking and HARKing lurk among standard research practices in this area. This project employs crowdsourcing to address these issues. It draws on replication, deliberation, meta-analysis and harnessing the power of many minds at once. The Crowdsourced Replication Initiative carries two main goals, (a) to better investigate the linkage between immigration and social policy preferences across countries, and (b) to develop crowdsourcing as a social science method. The Executive Report provides short reviews of the area of social policy preferences and immigration, and the methods and impetus behind crowdsourcing plus a description of the entire project. Three main areas of findings will appear in three papers, that are registered as PAPs or in process.},

  abstract = {This study explores how researchers’ analytical choices affect the reliability of scientific findings. Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers’ expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95\% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team’s workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers’ results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested. These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings.},

Un primer conjunto de capítulos pone el foco en las características distintivas y en las transformaciones históricas y recientes de las estructuras sociales de América Latina. Un segundo bloque se centra en las experiencias, identidades, preferencias políticas y biografías desiguales en la región. Finalmente, los capítulos que se reúnen en la tercera parte del libro abordan nuevas preguntas y enfoques en torno a las desigualdades. En su conjunto, este volumen constituye un insumo fundamental para la construcción de consensos sociales y de agendas políticas que promuevan la igualdad en nuestras sociedades. La colección Miradas Latinoamericanas. Un Estado del Debate tiene como objetivo relevar las novedades teóricas, metodológicas y temáticas en diversos campos del saber, tanto a través de perspectivas trans e interdisciplinares, como desde diferentes tradiciones intelectuales.

En este sentido, sería esperable que las preferencias por un rol más o menos activo del Estado en la redistribución se relacionara con distintas identificaciones partidarias y con el continuo izquierda-derecha. El presente artículo cuestiona este supuesto, proponiendo que procesos de desestructuración ideológica han llevado a que la identificación con partidos no constituya actualmente un elemento de clivaje político en Chile. Los datos a analizar provienen de la encuesta International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), aplicada en Chile en 1999 y 2009. Los resultados indican que existen escasas diferencias de preferencias distributivas entre quienes se identifican con distintos partidos políticos.},

  abstract = {El interés por el estudio de la cohesión social posee una larga trayectoria tanto académica como así también desde el estado y de organizaciones con interés público. La cohesión social aparece como una aspiración normativa de una sociedad mejor, vinculada a conceptos como lazos sociales de calidad, pertenencia, y confianza en los demás y en el estado. Se asume también que un estado de adecuada cohesión social es producto de condiciones estructurales y políticas que apunten a mayor igualdad, integración y oportunidades, por lo cual muchas veces se refiere a ella como un horizonte o una consecuencia de buenas políticas sociales. Sin duda este horizonte normativo reaparece con fuerza en tiempos caracterizados por crisis económica producto de la pandemia, polarización política, y la extrema concentración de ingreso y privilegios que caracteriza las sociedades actuales y donde el caso Chileno claramente no es una excepción. El renovado interés por la cohesión social nos lleva necesariamente a volver sobre su definición, sus alcances y su medición. Si bien existen muchas diferencias en las aproximaciones y definiciones en este tema, en los últimos años surge una convergencia hacia el carácter multidimensional de la cohesión social, que incorpora elementos como relaciones sociales de igualdad, sentido de pertenencia y orientación hacia el bien común. Partiendo desde una definición de cohesión social de la CEPAL (2021), este reporte de investigación presenta inicialmente una propuesta de indicadores de cohesión social basada en la Encuesta Longitudinal Social de Chile - ELSOC 2016-2020, producida por COES. El carácter longitudinal-panel de esta encuesta nos permite realizar posteriormente un análisis de los cambios ocurridos en nueve indicadores de cohesión social en Chile entre los años 2016 y 2020. Finalmente, se presenta una propuesta de tres perfiles de cohesión social en la sociedad chilena así como también su caracterización socioeconómica y regional.},

  abstract = {Aproximaciones tradicionales desde la ciencia política señalan que la desigualdad económica constituye un elemento desestabilizador de las democracias, en tanto merma las bases del contrato social y genera fuertes presiones para la redistribución, tensionando de paso la estabilidad institucional. Tal argumento da por sentado que los individuos son capaces de percibir la desigualdad adecuadamente, es decir, que existiría una correspondencia entre la desigualdad objetiva y subjetiva. Sin embargo, la evidencia empírica señala la existencia de una serie de sesgos en la percepción de la desigualdad (Castillo, Miranda y Carrasco, 2012), los cuales a su vez podrían influir en el impacto que la desigualdad tiene en la estabilidad institucional. En este contexto, cabe preguntarse: ¿En qué medida se percibe la desigualdad económica en Chile? ¿Existe consenso o disenso en la población respecto de los niveles de desigualdad? ¿Se percibe en Chile más o menos desigualdad que en otros países? El presente artículo aborda estas preguntas enfocándose en la desigualdad salarial desde dos ejes de análisis: comparación internacional y comparación temporal. El eje de comparación temporal aborda los niveles de consenso respecto de la desigualdad percibida en un lapso de 10 años, mientras la comparación internacional asocia la desigualdad percibida a indicadores de desigualdad económica en una serie de países. Para el análisis se utiliza el módulo de desigualdad del International Social Survey Programme 1999 (N=1.503) y 2009 (N=1.505), encuesta especializada en temas de desigualdad económica.},

Los datos estudiados corresponden a la encuesta del Proyecto Internacional en Justicia Social (International Social Justice Project, ISJP), en la que Chile participó el año 2007. Resultados del análisis multivariado indican que hay signos de consenso respecto de la brecha salarial considerada justa en la población, lo que apoya argumentos en la dirección de la legitimación de la desigualdad.},

Furthermore, it identifies some respondents’ characteristics and preferences that could be related to the justice evaluation of different pension amounts.

Results Findings indicate that although there is a consensual demand for larger pensions, it is still believed that pensions should be allocated primarily based on individual achievement. Conclusions Although in general, larger pensions are on average considered as more just, the justice criteria rely heavily on individual achievement over redistributive considerations, showing willingness to accept very low pensions for those considered not deserving them.},

  abstract = {La investigación empírica en el área de la participación política  ha demostrado consistentemente que los mayores niveles de  participación están en general asociados a un nivel socioeconómico  alto, particularmente a un mayor nivel de educación (Brady et al.,  1995; Dalton, 1988; Han, 2009; Lijphart, 1997; Marien et al., 2010). Esta  asociación estaría acentuada en contextos de una mayor desigualdad  económica, dado que esta implica que una pequeña parte de la  población posee la mayor parte de los ingresos y privilegios, los que  a su vez reproducen una polarización del estatus socioeconómico.  A través de este proceso circular, una gran desigualdad económica  reproduce la desigualdad en términos políticos, lo que no solo amenaza  el principio de equidad –que es la piedra angular de la democracia (un  ciudadano=un voto)–, sino también la legitimidad y estabilidad del  mismo sistema democrático. Reducir la brecha de desigualdad de origen es uno de los objetivos  fundamentales de la educación, la cual –supuestamente– puede lograr  esta tarea sirviendo como mecanismo principal para la movilidad  social. Sin embargo, basándose en los distintos resultados de las pruebas  de logro académico, es evidente que esta meta está lejos de ser lograda  en nuestro país: el origen socioeconómico de los estudiantes continúa  siendo un predictor fundamental del desempeño académico (Bravo et al.,  2008; Manzi et al., 2007; Mizala et al., 2004 y 2007; Mizala y Romaguera,  2002). Ya que los colegios transfieren a sus alumnos elementos que van  más allá del mero conocimiento académico, este estudio se concentrará  en las siguientes preguntas: ¿En qué medida el origen socioeconómico  de un estudiante influye en su futura participación política?, ¿son los  colegios capaces de reducir esta asociación? y ¿cuánto ha cambiado esta  asociación a lo largo del tiempo? Para responder estas preguntas, el presente artículo utiliza los  datos provistos por los estudios de educación cívica y ciudadana de  la Asociación Internacional para la Evaluación de Logro Educativo  (IEA), aplicados en Chile en 1999 (Estudio de Educación Cívica,  CIVED) y 2009 (Estudio Internacional de Educación Cívica y  Ciudadana, ICCS). Contar con la información de estos estudios  permitió a los investigadores analizar el conocimiento cívico y las  actitudes políticas entre estudiantes de octavo básico, representando  una oportunidad única para la investigación a nivel nacional.  En el presente texto, nos enfocamos en las expectativas de  participación política, un tema que está presente en ambos estudios  (CIVED, ICCS) y que, por ende, permitirá comparaciones a lo largo  del tiempo. En el contexto de este escrito, el concepto participación  política se refiere a la dimensión de la participación que se relaciona  con el involucramiento con instituciones políticas formales y sus  prácticas, tales como ejercer el voto y registrarse en organizaciones  políticas (Chanan, 2003; Putnam, 1993; Schulz et al., 2010). Para  contextualizar el análisis, este artículo comienza introduciendo la  situación de Chile en relación con la desigualdad económica y la  participación política, así como también el rol que tienen los temas  cívicos y de ciudadanía en el currículo escolar chileno.},

Se analizaron las respuestas a una escala de 10 indicadores de la encuesta Justicia Social y Participación Ciudadana, aplicada a una muestra probabilística estratificada por conglomerados en Chile el año 2013 (N = 1245). Basados en evidencia previa, se estimó un modelo factorial confirmatorio de atribuciones internas y externas, tanto para pobreza como riqueza (cuatro factores), en base al cual se estima un modelo de segundo orden de dos factores, uno de atribuciones internas y otro de atribuciones externas. Los resultados entregan por primera vez evidencia de atribuciones comunes para la riqueza y la pobreza.},

La alta aprobación ciudadana de estas demandas (llegando a un 89\%) parece sugerir la existencia de un gran consenso acerca de la debilidad del modelo educacional que existe en Chile, el que no cumpliría los tradicionales ideales de meritocracia y movilidad social que fundan los sistemas educativos en sociedades modernas. En este contexto, una pregunta que permanece abierta es en qué medida estas demandas por un sistema educacional más equitativo están principalmente influidas por ideales de equidad distributiva, o si más bien ellas responden a diferentes motivos racionales asociadas a condiciones socio-económicas de los individuos. Utilizando datos del módulo de inequidad social del International Social Survey Program (ISSP) de 2009, esta investigación analiza percepciones y creencias distributivas respecto al sistema educativo así como el modo en que ellas están influidas por variables educacionales y de ingreso, usando un modelo de ecuaciones estructurales. Los resultados revelan la presencia de diferencias socioeconómicas en relación a la justicia del sistema educativo, cuestionando el supuesto de un consenso normativo.},

Los resultados indican que, si bien las preferencias por impuestos progresivos son mayoritarias, han disminuido desde el año 1999 hasta la fecha, contrastando con un aumento en la crítica a la desigualdad. Se concluye que las diferencias esperables en opiniones sobre los impuestos según nivel socioeconómico, posición política y creencias meritocráticas no poseen asidero en el caso chileno.

Based on the analysis of this survey – applied to a sample of 189 Santiago residents – the present paper is aimed at exploring the influence of variables such as occupational status, sex, educational level, ethnic description, and family composition in the determination of a just earning.

  abstract = {Economic inequality is usually assumed to be a threat to social cohesion and democracy. Nevertheless, this opposition of inequality and democracy is based on further assumptions such as (a) that people perceive economic inequality accurately, and (b) that, by and large they consider inequality unjust. Research into distributive issues has not found consistent support for neither of these assumptions. Quite the contrary, empirical evidence indicates that economic inequality is widely misperceived and that inequality is to some extent considered legitimate. So far most of the empirical evidence in the area of legitimacy comes from experimental studies in the developed world. The present research aims at widening the scope of legitimacy studies by focusing on Chile as a case country, one of the societies with the highest economic inequality worldwide, guided by the question to what extent is economic inequality considered legitimate in a context of high economic inequality? In addressing this question, and based on previous evidence, the article proposes a way to evaluate (a) the legitimacy of inequality at a country level via survey research, and (b) the role of inequality perception and justice ideologies in the justification of economic inequality. The data to be analyzed is the public opinion survey International Social Justice Project (ISJP), implemented in Chile in the year 2007 (n = 890). Multivariate analysis results reveal signs of legitimacy of inequality in Chile, opening a series of issues regarding the acceptance and stability of unequal distributions.},

  abstract = {This research is an empirical study of the legitimacy of economic inequality with a focus on the case of Chile. Chile is an appealing case study in this regard because it has been one of the countries with the highest indexes of economic inequality over the past several decades. Theoretical perspectives based on the rational interest of the median voter have pointed out a negative association between high levels of inequality and legitimacy. Nevertheless, empirical evidence indicates that an unequal distribution of income is not necessarily challenged by the majority of a society, a phenomenon associated with the concept of legitimacy of economic inequality. Most empirical studies of this topic to date have considered social contexts that are not characterized by (comparatively) high levels of income inequality; thus, the impact of the level of inequality on its legitimacy remains largely unclear. The present study aimed at bridging this research gap, guided by the question: How do high levels of income inequality in a society influence the legitimacy of economic inequality? Using data obtained by comparative public opinion projects including the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and the International Social Justice Project (ISJP), this research considered individual preferences for occupational earnings inequality (the just earnings gap) as the main object of study. The central hypothesis was that individual preferences are strongly influenced by contextual standards such as the current income distribution, leading individuals of countries with high levels of inequality to have stronger average preferences for economic inequality (the so-called existential argument). Empirical evidence of legitimacy was related to two central dimensions based on David Beetham's multidimensional concept of legitimacy: (a) consensus regarding the inequality in the distribution of earnings in Chile and (b) the impact of the country level of income inequality on individual preferences for a larger just earnings gap. The empirical analysis provided partial evidence regarding the consensus about inequality in Chile, whereas in an international comparative framework, countries with higher levels of income inequality showed a stronger preference for a larger just earnings gap.},

  abstract = {Large-scale international studies focus most of their efforts on measuring knowledge as academic achievement. For this reason, more attitudinal instruments, such as questionnaires for students, teachers, and principals, are left in an instead auxiliary role. In the case of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009, in addition to measuring civic knowledge as academic achievement, a series of relevant instruments are considered within the concept of citizenship, aimed at measuring attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours. To encourage the use of the ICCS database incorporates’ variables built based on composite indices (estimated with Item Response Theory [IRT]) of those scales that address the same issue, such as trust in institutions, participation, school climate, attitudes towards ethnic minorities, among others. Frequently ICCS’s variables are used as they come in the database without stopping to analyse or problematize the validity of these measurements and their consequences in terms of contrasting hypotheses. Using the scale of attitudes towards equal rights between men and women, this chapter begins by describing, in general terms, the characteristics of ICCS and then moves on to factor analyses that show the possible validity problems that can arise from the use of the scores proposed by ICCS. The conclusions address the implications in terms of validity.},

Furthermore, recent research suggests that children who come from low status families are already less willing to get politically involved. The present paper aims to analyze the possible impact that schools can have in mitigating the effect of parents' socioeconomic status on students' expected electoral participation, focusing on two variables: civic knowledge and classroom climate. The analyses are based on a series of multilevel models using Chilean data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2009. The results support the influence of students' socioeconomic background on expected electoral participation. Furthermore, civic knowledge and classroom climate show a positive and similar influence on students' expected participation. However, classroom climate appears less affected by students' background than civic knowledge, opening the discussion about which strategy should be emphasized when aiming to mitigate the political participation gap.},

Based on a series of studies using ISSP data, the present paper proposes a multidimensional measurement framework for meritocratic beliefs. This framework dis- tinguishes, on the one side, between perceptions and preferences and, on the other side, between meritocratic and not meritocratic aspects. In the first study, we test the multidimensional framework for meritocratic beliefs using the ISSP 2009 inequality module through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques. After identify- ing the advantages and some limitations of ISSP items for a multidi- mensional operationalization of meritocratic beliefs, in a second study, we suggest a modified set of items that better taps the differ- ent dimensions of meritocracy. We examined the measuring proper- ties of this new instrument using a sample of Chilean adults (N ¼ 2,141). Based on these results, we recommend improvements in measuring meritocratic beliefs in cross-national studies.},

  abstract = {Datos recientes de opinión pública de la encuesta del Centro de Estudios Públicos ( CEP ) de octubre-septiembre 2013 señalan que un 63\% de la pobla- ción nacional estaría a favor de una reforma tributaria, mientras en junio de 2014 este porcentaje cae a un 40\% (Plaza Pública – CADEM ). Más allá de anali- zar las diferencias en los promedios de aprobación, el objetivo de este artículo es explorar qué variables individuales y contextuales se asocian a una mayor o menor aprobación de mayores impuestos, y también a la percepción de la pro- porción de impuestos que pagan los más ricos. En este contexto existen escasos antecedentes a nivel nacional, salvo por la evidencia que las preferencias hacia la redistribución vía impuestos están escasamente explicadas por la identificación con partidos políticos, pero sí mediante la identificación ideológica con el eje izquierda-derecha (Castillo, Madero-Cabib, \& Salamovich, 2013). Un primer paso para avanzar en el análisis desde la perspectiva de la justicia distributiva en las actitudes hacia los impuestos, consiste en la distinción analítica entre los conceptos de (des)igualdad y justicia. Desde el discurso público ambos términos se utilizan muchas veces como equivalentes, lo cual lleva a asumir que la desigualdad es necesariamente injusta. Tal asociación entre igualdad y justicia es clave en la filosofía política, que se aboca a la discusión normativa respecto de los principios que deberían operar en una sociedad para que la distribución resultante pueda ser calificada como justa. Ya que la igualdad absoluta no se asume como principio de justicia, sino una igualdad proporcional o relativa, la pregunta que se abre es sobre qué tipo de desigualdad puede ser considerada justa (Krebs, 2000). De la misma manera, la aproximación empírica a la justicia distributiva no asume que para las personas igualdad y justicia son lo mismo, sino que justamente se trata de preguntar a las personas qué es lo que piensan de la igualdad, cuánta desigualdad perciben en la sociedad y qué nivel de igualdad/desigualdad es considerada justa. Desde esta perspectiva, en el presente trabajo se analizarán una serie de indicadores de opinión pública en el tema particular de impuestos y redistribución en Chile, y también en comparación internacional. Para ello, se utilizarán datos de la encuesta del International Social Survey Programme 2009, que es el estudio comparativo internacional más especializado en temas de opiniones respecto a la desigualdad económica. Además, para el caso chileno se pondrá el foco en la comparación con la versión anterior de esta encuesta –el año 1999–, con el objetivo de analizar el cambio en percepciones y creencias en un lapso de diez años.},

Tal pregunta requiere ser abordada con anterioridad al análisis de los cambios del constructo en el tiempo y de sus posibles determinantes, ya que de otra manera se corre el riesgo de cometer errores en la estimación. El procedimiento denominado medición de invarianza longitudinal se centra específicamente en esta situación, permitiendo identificar en qué medida el constructo medido es estable (invariante) en el tiempo. Sin embargo, la medición de invarianza longitudinal aparece escasamente reportada en la literatura empírica, tanto por la baja cantidad de encuestas longitudinales que incluyen constructos latentes así como también porque requiere cierta sofisticación metodológica en el contexto de ecuaciones estructurales. Tomando datos de las tres mediciones de la encuesta longitudinal “Generaciones Políticas” realizada en Chile entre los años 2005-­‐2008, el presente trabajo analiza la invarianza longitudinal del constructo de autoritarismo. Luego de especificar los distintos niveles posibles de invarianza y de su forma de medición, el análisis indica que la escala de autoritarismo posee invarianza a un nivel parcial. Los resultados son discutidos en relación a la necesidad de especificar posibles fuentes de invarianza antes de proceder con modelos explicativos longitudinales, tales como los modelos de curvas latentes.},

The analysis is performed in a multilevel framework, to account for both family socioeconomic status and individual school characteristics. The results support the hypothesis that social origin continues to have a strong influence on students’ attitudes toward political participation, in the context of the two measurement points. The resulting discussion focuses on the role of schools in reducing socioeconomic differences, an issue that acquires additional relevance in societies with high inequality such as Chile.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted social interactions and coexistence around the globe in dimensions that go far beyond health issues. In the case of the Global South, the pandemic has developed along with growing migratory flows, generating actual and potential threats to social cohesion. In effect, migrants have historically served as ‘scapegoats’ for unexpected crises as a way to control and manage diversity. Chile is nowadays one of the main destination focus for migration in the Latin American region, where recently certain COVID-19 outbreaks in migrant housing have intensified discrimination. In such a context, there is a need for understanding how the pandemic has potentially changed the way local nationals perceive migrant neighbors in terms of a threat to national identity, labor market participation and conviviality. Drawing on the national social cohesion panel survey study ELSOC (2016-2021, N= 2927) the main aim of this paper is to analyze the changes in attitudes towards migrants over the last years and their relation with individual status and territorial factors. The results indicate that Chileans perceive Latin American and Caribbean migrants more negatively after the pandemic, particularly those respondents with lower educational levels and who live in increasingly multicultural neighborhoods with higher rates of migrant residents},

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that schools often justify student performance differences using meritocratic ideals. One potential consequence of such ideals is the legitimization of outcome inequalities across various spheres, including those traditionally associated with equality and redistribution. In this study, we argue that the promotion of meritocratic values during school age can shape students’ beliefs about meritocracy and influence their views on market-based access to health, pensions, and education. Using data from the 2017 National Study of Civic Education in Chile, which includes 5047 eighth-grade students from 231 schools, we estimated a series of multilevel models (lme4 library, R version 4.1.3) to test our hypotheses. Our findings show that a significant proportion of Chilean students agree with market justice principles—more so than adults. Most students endorse meritocratic views, particularly the notion that effort should be rewarded, which strongly correlates with market justice preferences: students who believe in meritocracy are more likely to justify inequalities based on financial capacity. At the school level, market justice preferences are higher in high-status schools but lower in schools with higher academic achievement. Furthermore, the conditional influence of meritocratic beliefs diminishes in schools with higher socioeconomic status and performance levels. These results suggest that the association between meritocratic beliefs and market justice preferences is already established at school age and is shaped by the school environment.},

El presente trabajo apunta a cuestionar esta idea de homogeneidad respecto de solidaridad, proponiendo que las conductas solidarias se relacionan con los recursos que las personas poseen, los que a su vez se asocian al lugar que las personas ocupan en la estructura de estratificación social. Tomando los datos de la Encuesta de Solidaridad realizada en 2009 por el Centro de Medición MIDE UC de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, el trabajo se centra en un tipo de conducta de ayuda particular: las donaciones en dinero. El análisis se focaliza en la influencia de recursos personales como ingreso, educación y pertenencia a redes sobre este tipo de donaciones. Los resultados indican que los individuos con mayores recursos son más proclives a las donaciones, donde el nivel educacional alcanzado juega un papel preponderante.},

  abstract = {In a developing and highly unequal region like Latin America, it is crucial to understand the determinants that affect people’s agreement with the redistribution of resources from the state. A series of theories focused on self-interest have continuously established a negative link between people’s income and their support for the reduction of inequalities through redistribution. Despite this, the evidence is scarce and sometimes contradictory while its study in Latin America is almost non-existent. Using data from the LAPOP Survey between 2008 and 2018, a longitudinal dimension is considered for the first time in the measurement of Latin American redistributive preferences, using hybrid multilevel regression models. In contrast to the evidence from studies conducted in other regions, the results reveal that in Latin America it is not possible to detect a clear association between income and redistributive preferences at specific times, but it is possible when changes occur in countries’ levels of inequality and economic development. Likewise, other elements that consistently affect preferences are evident, such as educational level, political ideology, and confidence in the political system. In light of this evidence, comparisons are made with previous research findings in industrialized countries, challenging rationalist theories of justice and solidarity.},

  abstract = {The study of poverty and wealth attribution has played a central role in the literature on the justification of social inequalities. Research on this topic has examined the extent to which individualistic versus structural reasons are used to explain why some people reach advantaged or disadvantaged positions in comparison to the rest of the population. This article attempts to explain how these reasons have changed over time in Chile, which has experienced vast economic transformation yet has maintained income inequality. From two national surveys produced in 1996 and 2015, descriptive results show that individualistic attributions for poverty and wealth (e.g., personal initiative) have increased and structural reasons (e.g., unemployment, economic policy) have declined. Latent class analysis (LCA) offers a second reading of the data, demonstrating that the decline of structural attributions is related to an increase in people choosing both individualistic and structural reasons for explaining poverty and wealth. Those changes in attribution patterns are discussed within the frame of cultural and economic transformation in Chilean society. El estudio de las atribuciones de pobreza y riqueza ha tenido un rol central en la literatura sobre la justificacion de las desigualdades sociales. La investigacion en esta area ha explorado en que medida se usan razones individualistas versus estructuralistas para explicar por que ciertas personas logran posiciones mas precarias o aventajadas que el resto. En esa linea, este articulo busca dar cuenta de como cambian en el tiempo estas razones, en el contexto de una sociedad que ha tenido grandes transformaciones estructurales en las ultimas decadas, donde ademas se mantiene una alta desigualdad de ingresos, como es el caso de la sociedad chilena. Tomando dos encuestas con representatividad nacional de los anos 1996 y 2015, los resultados indican en un primer nivel descriptivo que han aumentado las atribuciones individualistas sobre el origen de la pobreza y la riqueza--tales como la falta de esfuerzo y la iniciativa personal--y que han bajado las razones de caracter estructural--como el desempleo o las politicas economicas--. No obstante, a traves de un analisis de clases latentes (LCA), se ofrece una segunda aproximacion mas matizada a este fenomeno, mostrando que la baja de atribuciones estructurales se asocia al aumento de personas que atribuyen tanto razones individualistas como estructurales a la pobreza y riqueza, predominando una combinacion de ambas a la hora de significar estos hechos. Estos cambios en los patrones de atribucion se discuten en el marco de las transformaciones economicas y culturales de la sociedad chilena.},

We rely on distributive justice theory as a starting point, but we integrate insights from social psychology to enrich it. As such, we argue that people evaluate more unfairness when they live in contexts that are more unequal but that such an evaluation differs as a function of people’s ideologies. We examine how societal factors and ideologies shape distributive fairness evaluations to test this idea empirically. On the one hand, we examine whether distributive fairness evaluations have changed in LA over the last 23 years, and if so, how societal factors associate with such change. On the other hand, we test the extent to which ideological beliefs can explain people’s distributive fairness evaluations, that reach beyond structural and situational variables. Indeed, previous research showed that people evaluate less unfairness in the income distribution in LA when objective inequality was reduced between 1997 and 2015 (Reyes \& Gasparini, 2021). Our chapter builds on this research and extends it as we broaden the period (from 1997-2020), use all the spectrum of fairness evaluations (from fair to unfair), look at the different patterns of change between countries, and analyze the role of ideological beliefs on justice evaluations.},

Despite people\&\#39;s desire for reducing extreme inequalities, they still have mixed opinions regarding how to do so. The aim of the article is to examine the underlying latent dimensions of support for redistribution and test its correlates to perceptions of and attitudes toward inequality. In two studies with independent samples from Colombia, we found that support for redistribution can be modelled as a latent construct depicting two different dimensions: one focus on taxing the wealthy and changing the income distribution schema, and other focused on assisting people in need and providing opportunities. We also found that the dimension related to taxing the wealthy (vs. assisting people in need) displayed higher internal reliability and correlated consistently with perceptions and attitudes toward attitudes: the higher the support for taxing the wealthy, the higher the perceptions and concerns of inequality, and the lower the inequality-justifying ideologies. This research unveils an underlying dimension of support for redistribution that shed light on what drives people’s redistributive preferences.},

De este modo, el objetivo del presente estudio es evaluar la relación tanto del apoyo de la familia, como del de los pares con la sintomatología depresiva, ansiosa y de estrés postraumático en víctimas de abuso sexual. Participaron 93 adolescentes de género femenino (edades entre 12 y 17 años). Las participantes respondieron escalas para evaluar la sintomatología y para evaluar su percepción del apoyo social recibido. Los resultados de un análisis de regresión múltiple muestran que la percepción de apoyo por parte de la familia se asocia inversamente a los tres tipos de síntomas. En cambio, la percepción de apoyo de los pares únicamente se asocia inversamente a la sintomatología depresiva. Estos resultados dan cuenta de que la familia sigue siendo el principal agente protector, aún en la etapa de la adolescencia. Los pares, en cambio, poseerían menos recursos de protección y su rol estaría más centrado en la distracción.},

  abstract = {Social structures in contemporary societies have undergone significant changes over the last few decades. In advanced economies, there has been an increase in socio-economic inequality and pressure to dismantle the welfare state. At this juncture of institutional change, understanding citizens' preferences about how social policies should be financed becomes crucial, as these attitudes are critical for supporting or impeding policy reforms. Several studies have examined the support for welfare policies among citizens. However, some puzzles persist in the literature. Research on the topic, especially in USA, has largely concluded that citizens are uninformed of the levels of income inequality in their societies, even when informed, it is not clear their support for redistributive policies. Furthermore, a large body of research on American Dream ideology and system justification theory assumes that these ideologies predisposes voters to put high value on individual factors as critical ways to reduce economic inequality. However, most of the studies does not consider the reverse: information about rising economic inequality may also have a negative effect on beliefs about the opportunities of upward social mobility. Finally, most of the existing evidence concerns advanced societies, lacking information about developing contexts.  In such a context, the present study aims at filling some of the gaps by examining whether exposure to objective information about economic inequality and poverty affects perceptions about opportunities and meritocracy in Chile. Chilean society has experimented strong structural changes in the last 30 years, being the substantial decrease in the level of poverty over the last decades one of the most salient transformations. By using this trend, the present investigation aims to contribute to the understanding of the effect of information about dimensions of socio-economic inequality on individuals’ beliefs, through an experimental study. Specifically, the study assesses how information about changes in the social structure of Chilean society affect the perception about the importance of structural and individual factors in “getting ahead”. We derive our main hypotheses from the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality (McCall et al., 2017). Drawing on studies that focus on beliefs about inequality and opportunity rather than redistributive preferences, this model proposes that perceptions of increasing economic inequality generates skepticism about the existence of economic opportunities in the society. Furthermore, we evaluate the direction of perceptions’ updates to identify heterogeneity among participants in the experiment. To test our hypotheses, we applied survey experiments to convenience samples of Chileans in 2019 and 2020 via Netquest, an online panel company that produces heterogenous samples for several Latin American countries. We present findings of two studies. The first experimental study seeks to evaluate the role that information about income inequality and poverty in Chile has on perception of opportunities and the other one evaluates perceptions’ updates with moderators that captures previous knowledge about income inequality. Findings indicate that while factual information about large inequality increase support for structural factors and undermines the belief in meritocracy, information about evolution of poverty in the last decades in Chile also increases the support for the role of social origin in getting ahead in the life. Results about moderators suggest that our informational treatments have very strong effects on the belief in the structural factor for low-income groups and respondents with strong attachment to egalitarian beliefs. We discuss practical and theoretical implications of these results.},

  abstract = {In this article, we explore the associations of people’s valuations of universal healthcare with risk exposure and humanitarianism across diverse institutional contexts. We argue that both micro-level factors increase the valuations. Furthermore, interactions between material interests and humanitarians are expected. This work also hypothesizes that institutional contexts with employment-independent healthcare systems should modify the effect of risk exposure. Following a comparative framework, we test the expectations by using the International Social Survey Programme 2011 health module for 28 developed and developing countries. Results suggest opposite effects for the factors under analysis. While risk exposure decreases the willingness to pay taxes for the provision of universal healthcare, humanitarianism strongly fosters the valuation. Furthermore, we find statistical significant interactions between material interests and humanitarianism. Results also suggest substantive cross-level interactions between risk exposure and healthcare systems. Findings are robust to different modeling strategies that control for standard micro-level variables (income and egalitarianism), individual factors and observed and unobserved country characteristics. The article lays out implications of these findings.},

Acknowledging the developmental nature of civic engagement, this study analyzes involvement in civic activities during early adolescence. We used latent class analysis to identify patterns of participation in a representative sample of Chilean adolescents. A four-class model was highlighted by two contrasting classes: an involved class, with high probabilities of participation, and an uninvolved class, with low probabilities of participation. A third class—volunteers—mostly participates in organizations involved in community service, religious or social causes. This type of participation conforms to the preservation of the status quo, in contrast to a more political or activist form of participation that challenges it. Classes were partially invariant by gender and socioeconomic status. Females were more prevalent in the involved class, and males in the uninvolved class. Adolescents’ interest in politics, discussion of political issues, citizenship self-efficacy, and school involvement were associated with higher odds of belonging to the involved class.},

  abstract = {La evidencia internacional en resultados de pruebas de logro académico indica consistentemente que factores socioeconómicos son variables determinantes en los puntajes alcanzados en estas mediciones. Tal asociación, sin duda, tiene una repercusión en la reproducción de la desigualdad económica y, además, cuestiona el rol de la institución escolar como niveladora de las condiciones de origen. Por otro lado, sumado a la evidencia de logro en áreas tradicionales como lenguaje y matemática, estudios realizados en la última década señalan que la desigualdad de origen socioeconómico también impacta en ámbitos tales como el conocimiento en temas cívicos y ciudadanos. Dado que los conocimientos en temas cívicos y ciudadanos se asumen centrales para la integración exitosa en la vida ciudadana y política adulta, la influencia de factores socioeconómicos en estos temas traspasa la reproducción de desigualdad económica, generando fenómenos de reproducción de desigualdad política. Por otro lado, las escuelas son consideradas una institución clave en la nivelación de desigualdades socioeconómicas de origen, para la entrega de los conocimientos, habilidades y actitudes necesarias para la vida política, así como también en la provisión de oportunidades de movilidad social y de integración en la vida ciudadana adulta. En este sentido, resulta relevante conocer en qué medida el origen social de los estudiantes, así como también características socioeconómicas de las escuelas, influyen en los niveles de conocimiento cívico. Además, basados en la evidencia que relaciona conocimiento político y participación política en la vida adulta, el capítulo analiza en qué medida el conocimiento cívico de estudiantes se asocia a expectativas de participación política en el futuro. Para ello se analizan los resultados de la prueba de conocimiento cívico y el cuestionario del estudiantes de 8° básico que son parte del International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009) 1 . Este capítulo es, en parte, una extensión del capítulo de Castillo, Miranda y Bonhomme (en este volumen), donde también se estudian las expectativas de participación, pero nuestro foco se encuentra en el rol del conocimiento cívico así como también en la comparación internacional. Los objetivos principales de este capítulo consisten en: 1) analizar la relación entre variables de desigualdad socioeconómica (a nivel familiar y escolar) y los resultados en la prueba de conocimiento cívico en Chile; 2) analizar en qué medida los niveles de conocimiento cívico se relacionan con expectativas de participación cívica; y 3) respecto de la relación entre origen social, conocimiento cívico y participación, establecer cómo se posiciona Chile en el contexto internacional. Como contexto internacional entenderemos el conjunto de países que participaron en la prueba ICCS.},

Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis is used to estimate a measurement model of the egalitarian attitudes and its measurement equivalence across the 38 countries (n = 140,000 8th grade students) that participated in ICCS 2009. The results indicate that the original scales are non-invariant. Nevertheless, with some modifications, the proposed conceptual model was found to be invariant across countries.

  abstract = {Lack of tolerance toward traditionally disadvantaged groups, such as immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, represents a growing challenge to contemporary democracies. Assuming that attitudes toward such social groups are at least partly learned during the political socialization of school-age children, this chapter explores individual differences in equal rights attitudes using data from the last International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of eighth grade students from 38 countries. Using structural equations and multilevel models, the analysis estimates regression models using a set of measures, with family status being the main independent variable. The results show that there are large differences across countries regarding the level of inclusive attitudes, and that parental education and the number of books at home are relevant predictors of more inclusive attitudes of children in most of the countries analyzed; however, patterns differ by gender and immigrant groups. The findings are discussed, taking into account current and future political issues associated with migration and demands for equal rights.},

  abstract = {Trust in political institutions represents a central component of democratic systems. When citizens lack confidence in state bodies as the government and the parliament, the legitimacy of democracy is dangerously challenged. In the case of Latin America we observe a critical scenario, with a steady decrease of institutional trust in the last decade, accompanied by alarming levels of support for authoritarian regimes. Most of the evidence in this regards refers to adult population, leaving sidelined the young generations who certainly have a stake in the future of democracy in the region. Focusing on the role of the acquisition of civic knowledge at school as a protecting factor of democracy, this research analyzes the role of civic knowledge to understand trust in civic institutions and authoritarian attitudes in eighth-grade students. The data corresponds to the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 and 2016, in which seven Latin American Countries have participated. The results indicates a puzzling role of civic knowledge, as it diminishes trust in institutions but at the same time reduces authoritarian beliefs, in a similar way in the Latin American countries across time. The consequences for democracy and citizenship education are addressed in the conclusion.},

Si bien en el contexto latinoamericano Chile no es catalogado como un país altamente conflictivo, sí ha llamado la atención un aumento en el nivel de violencia que se genera en eventos públicos relacionados con expresión de demandas ciudadanas (UNDP, 2013). Gran parte de los estudios en el área han girado en torno a las características y clasificación de estos eventos y sus participantes (Bellei, Cabalin y Orellana, 2014; Donoso, 2013; Sepúlveda y Villaroel, 2012), así como sobre las posibles consecuencias en términos de cambio social y de una posible crisis de legitimidad de los sistemas políticos y de su capacidad de dar respuesta a la ciudadanía. Sin embargo, un elemento que aún se encuentra ausente en esta agenda de investigación corresponde al análisis de la percepción de distintos tipos de conflicto en Chile y al cambio de estas percepciones en el tiempo. Este aspecto nos parece relevante, dado que la conflictividad percibida de la sociedad podría asociarse no solamente a la presencia de mayores conflictos, sino también a las preferencias, actitudes y valores de los individuos, y posiblemente al lugar que los individuos ocupan en la estructura de estratificación. De esta manera, se abren las siguientes preguntas: ¿en qué medida se percibe conflicto en Chile? ¿Quiénes perciben más o menos conflicto? ¿Cómo ha cambiado la percepción de conflicto en el tiempo? En este escenario, este capítulo tiene dos objetivos principales. Por una parte, mapear el comportamiento de la percepción de conflicto en el Chile contemporáneo (2006-2013), en un contexto de crecientes demandas sociales y alto grado de movilización ciudadana. Y, por otra, presentar explicaciones tentativas a la formación de estas percepciones en Chile. A partir de la Encuesta Nacional Bicentenario, se dispone de una serie de tiempo única que permite documentar la conflictividad percibida de la sociedad chilena y su evolución de acuerdo a distintos clivajes sociales},

Second, using information about the performance of students during their first eight semesters in the university (n=1616), a longitudinal hierarchical analysis showed that writing remains a significant predictor of university grades over time, also after controlling socio-demographic variables and university admissions tests. Moreover, language skills retain or improve their predictive role over time, whereas mathematics skills seem to decrease in their importance. Our results show that writing, and the cognitive skills involved in writing, play a critical role in advanced stages of academic training, consequently offering additional support for the consideration of this ability for university admission purposes.},

The results show that the information originated from the writing and thinking assessments supplements the information provided by the academic measures. The inference and argument analysis tests did not replicate the achievement gap between public, voucher and private schools commonly observed in Chile. The results showed that gender differences in writing are relatively independent of gender differences in thinking.

We examine internal and external attributions of poverty using survey data from the 2006 International Social Justice Project (ISJP).

The results support our hypothesis that the amount of income inequality people perceive as just is related to how they explain the causes of poverty, that is, internal and/or external attributions.

Además se incluyen algunas de las causantes de mayor mortalidad en Chile (Enfermedades cardio y cerebrovasculares, Cáncer, Enfermedades respiratorias crónicas, Enfermedades hepáticas y Enfermedades renales), las cuales fueron agrupadas en una escala. La técnica de análisis empleada es la de regresión logística binaria. Resultados: Los análisis basados en modelos de regresión logística señalan que la satisfacción con los lazos sociales es el principal elemento de la cohesión social consistentemente favorable y potencialmente protector en la presencia de ECNT (Hipertensión 95\% IC 0.786-0.940; diabetes 95\% IC 0.795-0.969; otras ECNT 95\% IC 0.724-0.879). En cambio, los elementos de identificación con el barrio y propensión a la colaboración en el barrio no demuestran un efecto consistente ni significativo. Discusión: La promoción y el fortalecimiento de los lazos sociales podría contribuir a prevenir la presencia de Diabetes, Hipertensión y otras ECNT. Implementar estrategias públicas para el desarrollo de la cohesión social podría contribuir a compensar la insuficiencia de recursos físicos para enfrentar el aumento en la carga de ECNT y combatir las desigualdades en salud.},

  abstract = {In the wake of rising levels of income inequality during the past two decades, widespread concerns emerged about the social and political consequences of the widening gap between the poor and the rich that can be observed in many established democracies. Several empirical studies substantiate the link between macro-level income inequality and political attitudes and behavior, pointing at its broad and negative implications for political equality. Accordingly, these implications are expected to be accentuated in contexts of high inequality, as is the case in Latin America. Despite these general concerns about the consequences of income inequality, few studies have accounted for the importance of individual perceptions of distributive fairness in regard to trust in political institutions. Even less is known about the extent to which distributive fairness perceptions co-vary with objective indicators of inequality. Moreover, the research in this area has traditionally focused on OECD countries, which have lower indexes of inequality than the rest of the world. This study aims at filling this gap by focusing on the relevance of distributive fairness perceptions and macro-level inequality for political trust and on how these two levels interact in Latin American countries. The analyses are based on the Latinobarometer survey 2011, which consists of 18 countries. Multilevel estimations suggest that both dimensions of inequality are negatively associated with political trust but that higher levels of macro-level inequality attenuate rather than increase the strength of the negative association between distributive fairness perceptions and political trust.},
