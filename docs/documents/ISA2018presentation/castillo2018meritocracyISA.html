# The Meritocracy black box
&lt;center&gt;
![:scale 50%](blackbox.jpg)
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
"the idea of meritocracy may have many virtues, but clarity is not one of them” (Sen, 2000, p.1)
&lt;/center&gt;


???
This slide:

- Meritocracy is a concept widely used in sociological research, mainly from a critical perspective related to the unfulfilled promises of social mobility in modern societies.
- Nevertheless, few research so far has addressed the concept itself, remaining in a closed black box. There is not clarity in  the literature about what  meritocracy is, and this lack of clarity has had a consequence a series of limitations for empirical research.

In this presentation
- I am going to summarize some empirical studies of meritocracy with a focus on survey research,
- then I am going to discuss some conceptual limitations of meritocracy studies
- Finally, I propose a conceptual framework for the empirical study of meritocracy, which I test with ISSP 2009 inequality module

# Background
- "The rise of meritocracy" (Young, 1962)
  - Merit: Effort + Talent

- "Meritocracy and economic inequality" (Arrow, Bowles &amp; Durlauf, 2000)

- "The meritocracy myth" (McNamee &amp; Miller, 2004)

- "Meritokratie als Legitimationsprinzip" (Hadjar, 2008)

???

**Just a brief theoretical background**
- The main reference is Michael Young,who invented the term in his novel "The rise of meritocracy", not as an ideal but clearly as an irony of the dominant "meritocratic class" and finally the tragedy of the meritocratic society. He defined merit as a combination of effort and talent, a definition that prevails until today.

- Although for Young meritocracy actually was something negative, the use of the term until today has a positive value

- Then there are some few books on the topic, where it is possible to recognize three main focuses:

  - Normative: political philosophy, equity / proportionality theories
  - Descriptive: mainly stratification / educational research (Young)
  - Subjective: perceptions / beliefs / attitudes

**Summarizing the conceptual approaches to meritocracy**
- Here we can see the three described dimensions in the study of meritocracy: normative descriptive and subjective. From now on I am going to focus on the subjective dimension, which basically comprises perceptions (what is) and beliefs (what should be), and which are linked to the normative and descriptive dimensions.

**Papers studying meritocracy through survey research**

- There are a bunch of papers dealing with meritocracy and its determinats. 
- Although non of them deals with the measurement of meritocracy itself, still they make some operationalization choices with different consequences. 
- In my paper I review with more detail the operationalization of each of these papers, and next I am going to show you some few examples.

- Kunovich and Slomczynski (2007), ISSP 1992
  - 6 items of "reasons for pay" plus "the government should provide jobs for everyone who wants one" (reverse coded)

- Duru-Bellat and Tenret (2012), ISSP 2009
  - perceptions (what is) and beliefs (what should be), but use of single indicators and no measurement concerns

-  Reynolds and Xian (2014), GSS
  - Meritocratic and non-meritocratic perceptions (get ahead battery from GSS) "...how important you think it is for getting ahead in life"

???

- kunovich: uses reverse coded non-meritocratic items ... are the sa
- Duru-Bellat: single indicators
- Reynolds: substract merit from non merit, and they confuse beliefs with perception

  ### Limitations
]
.right-column[

- Use of "beliefs" for perceptions / preferences

- Mostly focused in either perceptions or preferences

- Wide use of non-meritocratic items reverse coded as meritocratic

  - Except for Reynolds and Xian (2014), scarce discussion and empirical test about the measurement of meritocracy

  - Except for Duru-Bellat and Tenret (2012), links between perceptions and preferences are not addressed.

## A conceptual proposal for studying meritocracy


-*Meritocracy*:

  - perceptions (ej: effort is rewarded)

  - beliefs(ej: effort should be rewarded)

-*Non-meritocracy*

  - perceptions (ej: contacts for getting a job)

  - beliefs (ej: it is ok to use contacts for getting a job)

## A conceptual proposal for studying meritocracy

A bi-dimensional conceptualization of the subjective dimension of meritocracy
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
![:scale 90%](general_f.png)
&lt;/center&gt;

???
- In this table it is possible to clasify meritocratic research (in the subjective dimension), and also to propose new forms to tap the different dimensions. 
- I am not saying that it is necessary to cover all of them in one single research, but just that in order to move on in this agenda we need to be more preciseabout what we are doing.

#Testing the model

## Objective

- To propose and test an operationalization for the bi-dimensional conceptualizacion of the subjective dimension of meritocracy

- Data: ISSP 2009

- Variables

  - *perceived meritocracy*: getting ahead battery

  - *preferred meritocracy*: reasons for pay battery

# Discussion

- Fuzziness of merit

- Different and unconnected empirical approaches

- Comprehensive bi-dimensional framework

- Seems to work so far, but needs further research
