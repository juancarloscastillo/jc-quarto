     RefManageR provides tools for importing and working with
     bibliographic references.  It greatly enhances the bibentry class
     by providing a class BibEntry which stores BibTeX and BibLaTeX
     references, supports UTF-8 encoding, and can be easily searched by
     any field, by date ranges, and by various formats for name lists
     (author by last names, translator by full names, etc.). Entries
     can be updated, combined, sorted, printed in a number of styles,
     and exported. BibTeX and BibLaTeX .bib files can be read into R
     and converted to BibEntry objects.  Interfaces to NCBI's Entrez,
     CrossRef, and Zotero are provided for importing references and
     references can be created from locally stored PDFs using Poppler.
     Includes functions for citing and generating a bibliography with
     hyperlinks for documents prepared with RMarkdown or RHTML.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     *Importing and Creating References*

     BibEntry objects can be created directly using the ‘BibEntry’
     function.  ‘.bib’ files can be read into R using the ‘ReadBib’
     function. Tools are provided for importing references from
     Crossref, Zotero, Google Scholar, and PDFs and looking up PubMed
     ID's and DOIs.  See ‘ReadPDFs’, ‘ReadZotero’, ‘ReadCrossRef’,
     ‘ReadGS’, ‘ReadPubMed’, ‘GetPubMedByID’, ‘GetPubMedRelated’.

     *Manipulating BibEntry objects*

     BibEntry objects may be searched and indexed by field values, name
     lists, keys, dates, date ranges, etc.  See ‘[.BibEntry’,
     ‘[<-.BibEntry’, ‘[[.BibEntry’, ‘$.BibEntry’.

     *Printing and Exporting Bibliographies*

     The ‘print.BibEntry’ function can print in a number of formats
     (e.g. text, html) and most of the base bibliography styles
     available with BibLaTeX (e.g. alphabetic, numeric, authortitle,
     and authoryear).  ‘toBibtex.BibEntry’ will convert a BibEntry
     object to a character vector containing lines of a BibTeX file,
     converting fields, entry types and expanding crossreferences as
     needed to coerce BibLaTeX entries to BibTeX.  ‘toBiblatex’
     converts the BibEntry object to a character vector containing
     lines of the corresponding BibLaTeX file.  The results can be
     written to a file using ‘WriteBib’.

     Citations can be generated in a number of styles using one of the
     available functions for citations.  A list of references can be
     printed based on the works the user has cited thus far in their
     document.  See ‘Cite’.  The citations and bibliography can be
     printed including hyperlinks using either the R Markdown or R HTML
     formats.

     *Additional features*

     All sorting methods for bibliographies available in the BibLaTeX
     LaTeX package have been implemented see ‘sort.BibEntry’ and the
     references.

     Using ‘open.BibEntry’ electronic copies of references can be
     opened in a PDF viewer or web browser.

     The convenience function ‘BibOptions’ is provided for setting
     defaults for commonly used functions such as ‘print.BibEntry’,
     ‘[.BibEntry’, and ‘Cite’.  Its interface is similar to ‘options’.
