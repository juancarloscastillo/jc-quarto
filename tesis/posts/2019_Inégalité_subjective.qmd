# Abstract

This thesis examines subjective inequality in Chile over time. With the return
of democracy (1990), the country experienced a sustained economic growth
which allowed it to reduce poverty levels and increase education rates. At the
same time, together with the development of a series of social policies, since
2000 the economic concentration of the country, historically ranked among
the highest in the world, has begun to diminish. However, as wellbeing levels
increased and inequalities diminished, a series of social demonstrations began
to take place, among them those led by the student movement in 2006 and
2011, considered the largest that the country has experienced since the end of
the dictatorship. This diagnosis grouped by all these demonstrations pointed
to the problem of social inequalities as a brake on the country’s’ development.
The high citizen support of these demonstrations had an impact on the con-
figuration of political agendas of all sectors, and led public debate to focus on
the question of whether the principles of justice, where Chilean society had
sustained its social pact after the dictatorship, had changed. Were trans-
formations in wellbeing conditions linked to a criticism of the market logic
that had legitimized high inequalities since the period of neoliberal reforms
promoted in the 1980s?

The thesis answers this question from the perspective of individuals, asking
how stable or fluid representations of inequality, as well as its determinants, are over time. From the analysis of a set of quantitative data (surveys ISSP
1999, ISSP 2009, SJCP 2013 and COES 2014) and qualitative data (40 semi-
directed interviews), it is established that representations of inequality can be
apprehended through three dimensions - perceptions, beliefs and preferences
- which are influenced by factors that operate at two levels: the social position
and the personal experience of individuals.
The results of the study show that representations changed over time, but
with varying intensity depending on the dimension analyzed. And by consid-
ering the determinants, on the one hand, results show that the social position
of individuals, especially with regards to educational level, is a strong pre-
dictor of representations of inequality. Following the transformations in the
social structure of Chile, individuals of lower social status present more sig-
nificant changes in the representations of inequality. On the other hand, in
terms of personal experience, it is observed that changes in the sociopolit-
ical context strongly influence representations, as well as the evaluation of
structural transformations on individuals’ lives. Regardless of social status,
individuals’ assessments of inequality are strongly anchored in comparing
different moments of their own biographies, even stronger than when they
represent inequality through a comparison with other people or social groups.

Keywords. Subjective inequality, social representations, social justice, Chile
